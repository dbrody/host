Natural Products - IDEO
================

## Getting Started

Natural Products requires the following tools for setup:

-  [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
-  [bower](http://bower.io)
-  [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) (*not required, but recommended as yeoman installs both grunt.js
and bower)

*NOTE: Although not required for development, the initial scaffolding was  generated using the [backbone generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone) for [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)*

Once these tools are installed, in the project root directory, run the following commands:

```
$ npm install #installs grunt dependencies
$ bower install #installs project packages
$ grunt server #command to start server on port 9000
```

## Version Control
The Digital Shop follows a process similar to the branching model discussed [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
